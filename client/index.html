        <h1>Comments</h1>
        <p>Comments is a thing I wrote to play around with three.js and WebSockets.
        It provides you an uninteresting infinite world and the ability to leave text comments anywhere in the world.</p>
        <p>This game isn't "proper" multiplayer: you can't see other players and you can't see comments as they're made.</p>
        <p>When you leave a comment, the server will store: your nickname, the comment text, your IP address, and your browser user-agent.</p>
        <p>I don't want to remove any comments, but please be respectful and don't post anything illegal. I can't be arsed to moderate a dumb thing I wrote to screw around.</p>
        <p>If the server crashes, it will restart after a few seconds. Refresh the page if you get a connection error.</p>

        <h2>Play</h2>
        <p>Scroll down on the play screen and read the controls!</p>
